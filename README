The program was made with the following process in mind. We decided to block/ignore signals by using pthread_sigmask. 
For each signal and thread, we blocked the other two signals. For example, SIGINT, SIGSTOP and SIGILL were blocked/ignored for sigmask.  
Then we created the thread which would run the thread function. Each thread had their own corresponding function which would just call 
a signal and run the adder. Furthermore, each signal was designated their own handler who would output the signal number and thread 
number if they were used. In the main function, we then joined all the threads together and unblocked the sigmask. We then also 
called signal to default and ended the code there.
